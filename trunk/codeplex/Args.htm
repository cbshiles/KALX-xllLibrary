<p>
    The <a href="http://xll.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/8651#134547">Args</a>&nbsp;class
    represents the arguments passed to <code>Register</code>. It can also be used for
    creating beautiful documentation using Sandcastle. The member functions correspond
    to the arguments required by <code>xlfRegister</code> except for the function <code>
        Documentation</code> which allows for additional documentation to be generated
    by the macro&nbsp;<code>XLL.DOC</code>.</p>
<p>
    The <code>AddIn</code> data is used to automatically generate Microsoft AML documents
    that Sandcastle can process into various forms of documentation. See the excellent
    <a href="http://sandcastlestyles.codeplex.com/">Sandcastle MAML Guide</a> for all
    the details. By default, the macro generates a Conceptual topics page that shows
    the <strong>Syntax</strong> and contains a table of the arguments to the function
    along with a short description.</p>
<p>
    The optional first argument to <code>AddIn::Documentation</code> is a string that
    will added to the <strong>Remarks</strong> owner() unless it starts with a left
    angle bracket (&lt;). In that case it is assumed the string already contains all
    the necessary markup and is pasted directly into the Conceptual document being generated.
    If an optional second argument is provided it will be placed in the <strong>See Also</strong>
    owner() of the document. Use <code>xml::xlink</code> and <code>xml::externalLink</code>
    to create internal cross references and external links respectively.</p>
