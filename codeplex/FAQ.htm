<dl>
    <dt><em>How come I am not seeing my function show up in the workbook or Function Wizard?</em></dt><dd>Most
        likely because you didn't load it. If you are running in the debugger, be sure to
        specify the full path to the Excel executable on your machine as the <code>Command</code>
        and <code>"$(TargetPath)"</code> as <code>Command Arguments</code> in <code>Properties|Configuration
            Properties|Debugging</code>.<br />
        <br />

    <dt><em>When I open my <code>.xll</code> file in Excel nothing happens.</em></dt><dd>You
        need to set macro security to low in order for Excel to register your functions
        and macros. For Excel 2003 and earlier, go to <code>Tools|Options...</code> and
        click on <code>Macro Security...</code> in the <code>Security</code> tab. For Excel
        2007 and later, from the Office Button click on <code>Excel Options</code> next
        to <code>Exit Excel</code> on the bottom right. On the Trust Center tab click on
        <code>Trust Center Settings...</code> On the <code>Macro Settings</code> tab choose
        <code>Enable all macros</code>.<br />

    <dt><em>How do I get my add-in to load every time I start Excel?</em> </dt>
    <dd>
        That is what the Excel <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/load-or-unload-add-in-programs-HP010096834.aspx#BMexceladdin">
            Add-in Manager</a> is for.<br />

    </dd>
    <dt><em>What is up with all those popups showing me errors and warnings?</em> </dt>
    <dd>
        The xll add-in library provides three levels of alerts: error, warning, and information.
        Hit Alt-F8 and type <code>ALERT.FILTER</code> to control which of these you see.

        Your choices are stored in the registry when you hit OK so they persist between
        Excel sessions. Hitting Cancel is equivalent to deselecting all alerts.<br />

    <dt><em>Why am I seeing a message box claiming Register failed for: X, where X is the
        Excel name of one of my functions?</em></dt><dd>You forgot to insert <code>#pragma XLLEXPORT</code>
            as the first line in the body of the corresponding C/C++ function.<br />
            <br />
        </dd>
    <dt><em>What can I do if <code>XLL.DOC</code> is not generating my help file?</em></dt><dd>Look
        in the Debug directory. You should see a folder with the same name as the xll you
        are building. In that you will find <code>.log</code> files. Look through them in
        alphabetical order for error messages.<br />
        <br />
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Why is <code>malloc()</code> failing while trying to allocate large amounts
        of memory?</em></dt><dd>You must compile with default char unsigned. <code>Properties|C/C++|Command
            Line|Additional Options: /J<br />
        </code>
            <br />
        </dd>
    <dt><em>How come the last arguments in the constructor of <code>AddIn</code> end with
        an extra character?</em></dt><dd>It is a known feature that persists in the Excel 2010
            SDK that the last character gets truncated.<br />
            <br />

    <dt><em>I'm using Vista/Windows 7 and can't veiw the Macrofun.hlp file.</em></dt><dd>You
        need to install the Windows Help program. Just follow the directions<br />
        <br />
    </dd>
    <dt><em>When I call my add-in function from Excel it returns <code>#VALUE</code>.</em></dt><dd>This
        can occur when there is a mismatch between the C signature you specify in the second
        argument to <code>AddIn</code> and the true signature.<br />
